TDDBootcampProject
==================

This is a simple Maven project that I developed in a bootcamp in 2012 practicing some TDD

The project idea is create a service  that would receive an String containing the type of 
reservation and a comma separated list of dates as following:

"Regular: 16Mar2009(mon), 17Mar2009(tues), 18Mar2009(wed)"

Then the service should return the cheapest hotel considering some business rules that 
take in consideration the type of reservation, hotel rates and if the days are week or weekend days.
